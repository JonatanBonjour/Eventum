# Eventum

Eventum is an app created to streamline the creation of events.

## Features

### Swipe

You can swipe left or right to deny or accept an event, respectively. Accepting an event means you are seen as an attendee to other users who accepted the same event and you can add the event to your calendar. You also can chat with the organizer and other attendees.

* Swipe an event :

* Attending lists all the events you have swiped to accept. Accessing an event from this menu gives you the opportunity to add this event to your calendar, chat with the organizer and attendees, see who will attend the event and the weather. You can also share a link of the event to others, this will open the app with the event on it.

* You can also display a map that shows you events nearby. Click on any red marker to see a quick description of the event and a photo. If you click on the image, you will be allowed accept or deny the event.

* If you do not find your happiness in the events proposed by others, you can always create your own events by clicking on the '+' on the top right corner. To create an event you need a title, a description, a time and date, an address and maybe some categories if you want other users to find your event more easily :
